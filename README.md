# RISCV CPU - Team 8

## Development

- [x] Finish single cycle CPU
  - [x] Finish individual modules
  - [x] Complete top level CPU
  - [x] Write testbench for top level
  - [x] Clean module names
- [ ] Pipelined processor
  - [ ] Pipelined control unit
  - [ ] Insert stage registers
  - [ ] Testbench for simple pipelined CPU
  - [ ] Hazard unit:
    - [ ] Data hazard handling by forwarding
    - [ ] Control hazard handling by stalling

## Testbench usage

Run all tests from the tb directory, `cd tb`

### Top Level Simulation

To simulate the CPU without any assertions (GTEST), there is a simple Verilog testbench to do so. This is the easiest way to see a program running on the CPU.  
This testbench inputs only rst and clk, compiling with IVerilog:

```
cd tb ; ./run_clock.sh
```

This outputs a register dump in the terminal and then opens GTKWave with the waveform loaded

### Top Level Verification

`./run.sh tests/{tb file}`

For example:

```
cd tb ; ./run.sh tests/verify.cpp
```

### Unit Level Verification

`./run.sh tests/unit_tests/{tb file}`

For example:

```
cd tb ; ./run.sh tests/unit_tests/RegFile_tb.cpp
```
